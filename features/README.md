# Features

Layer responsible for providing the features interacted with by the user. Each feature is ideally split into an **API** module and an **Implementation** module to ensure loose coupling and faster compilation.

## Functionalities

* **UI Components**: Screens and components built with Jetpack Compose.
* **ViewModels**: State management and interaction with the Domain layer.
* **Navigation**: Internal feature navigation and exposure of entry points via API modules.
